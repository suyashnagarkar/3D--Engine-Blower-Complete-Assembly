#3D model of an Engine Blower 
- Designed the complete engine blower assembly, including the
  housing, impeller, and inlet/outlet ducts. 
- Created 2D technical drawings for each component with detailed
  specifications, including dimensions, tolerances, and material
  selection.
- Developed a 3D model of the blower, incorporating features such
  as curved blades for enhanced airflow. Simulated airflow through
  the blower to evaluate performance and optimize blade geometry
  for improved efficiency. Produced exploded views and assembly
  instructions for easy reference during manufacturing and assembly.
- Software Used: SolidWorks
